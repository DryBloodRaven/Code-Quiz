# Code-Quiz

## Purpose
This project started with no code and was built from the groud up. <br />
I was tasked with building a code quiz that needed to have multiple questions stored and accessed when the quiz started. <br />
Once the quiz started a timer would start and this timer is what the overall score would be based off of. <br />
When someone answers a question incorrectly they needed to be penalized for their wrong answer. <br />
Once the timer ran out or the quiz was completed, the user would be prompted to input their initials. <br />
Their initials and high score would be stored and displayed proudly.
